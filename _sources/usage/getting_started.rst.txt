📘 Getting Started
===============

Computing features
------------------

To compute features on your data, a `FeatureCalculator` object must first be instantiated using:

.. code-block:: python

   from pyhctsa.calculator import FeatureCalculator
   calc = FeatureCalculator()

By default, the `FeatureCalculator` will initialize the full feature set. 
If you would like to specify a custom feature set, you can pass the corresponding configuration .YAML file as an argument to the `FeatureCalculator`:

.. code-block:: python

   custom_calc = FeatureCalculator(config_path="subset.yaml")

The number of master operations (callable functions) specified by the .yaml will be displayed for verification e.g., Loaded 700 master operations.
Once a `FeatureCalculator` has been initialized, you can call the extract method to compute time series features on either a single time-series instance or a list of multiple instances:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyhctsa.utils import get_dataset

    e1000 = get_dataset()
    data = e1000[0] # your data as a list, array, or pandas series
    res = calc.extract(data)

Note that each time-series instances does not have to be the same length to compute a vector of features. The results of the extraction will be returned in a pandas dataframe of shape 
N×F, where N is the number of time-series instances and F is the number of time-series features.

🤖 Calling Individual Operations
-----------------------------
If you would like to run individual operations on your data, you can access the corresponding functions from their respective modules directly. 
For example, to compute the `raw_hrv_meas` features on your data, the `raw_hrv_meas` master operation can be accessed from the `medical` module:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from pyhctsa.operations.medical import raw_hrv_meas
    data = ... # your ArrayLike data
    res = raw_hrv_meas(data) # result as either a dictionary or scalar value

Note that individual operations can only be called directly on individual time-series instances.

🏗️ Parallel Computing
---------------------
Time-series feature extraction is computationally intensive. 
To speed up processing, pyhctsa allows you to distribute the workload across multiple CPU 
cores on your local machine using the `LocalDistributor`:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from pyhctsa.distribute import LocalDistributor
    from pyhctsa.calculator import FeatureCalculator

    # initialize the calculator
    calc = FeatureCalculator()

    # create a LocalDistributor and specify the number of workers
    # it is generally recommended to set n_workers to the number of physical CPU cores
    dist = LocalDistributor(n_workers=4)

    # pass the distributor to the .extract() method
    res = calc.extract(data, distributor=dist)
